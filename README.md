# Technical Notes

This is a collection of notes about ideas I have for research of programming.
The entrypoint is [index.md].

The notes are given in `notes/`, and `./build.py` generates the `index.md` file.

If the first line in a note starts with a single hash, the rest of the line is the title.
Lines after the (optional) title that match (roughly) `tag: +[a-z-]+` or `tags: ([a-z-]+,)+` set tags for the note.
Searching for tags stops after the first non-blank line that does not match.

A count of the tags is also generated by `./build.py` and saved at `tags.txt`.
