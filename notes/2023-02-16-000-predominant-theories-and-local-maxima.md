# Predominant Theories and Local Maxima

tags: design, philosophy

I ran across a comment on someone's blog that had an interesting notion:

> when [some theory] becomes the predominant theory shaping everything,
  we run the great risk of not looking for something better

It makes me think of finding a local maximum in the space of design strategies.
I think that's a quite worthwhile thing to think about when approaching a novel design problem.
Let's call this idea a *design meta-strategy*.

The context of this comment requires some push-back, though.
It's not super interesting, and there's nothing after it;
  so now you're warned.

## Category Theory

This comment itself was referencing category theory.

Category theory certainly isn't the "predominant theory";
  it's quite the underdog as a foundation for mathematics.

The commenter further claimed "we have strong evidence already of something better [than category theory]".

This "something better" is not named or explicitly referenced in any way.
Even then, whatever this unnamed idea is, there is no indication of the manner in which it is supposed to be better,
  nor what evidence there is that is actually meets those claims.
As far as I know, category theory is an area of active research,
  especially as far as how it applied to programming languages.
Since category theory is getting better, I guess I know at least one better alternative:
  category theory itself.

Besides, category theory is the mathematical theory of composition.
If one's goal is to write composable software, what's wrong with category theory?

## Snide-ity

The original blog post was entitled "Attack of the Monadic Morons".
One commenter also agreed with the OP, adding
  "I could no longer stand the deluge of snide and derogatory remarks".

I don't really need to say that "moron" is a snide and derogatory description.

## Post Deletion

The post content itself was later deleted.
It was to be "replace with a proper rant at another time",
  but that was 9 years before I'm writing this.

I can't critique the original rant properly.
Perhaps its author thought their rant was too easy to critique?
Nor can I know which comments are related addressing the rant's points.
There's a whole lot of uncertainty cast over the entire comment chain now.

## Lisp-Centric Perspective

There's a general fanaticism of untyped and lisp-y language design throughout the rant-approving comments.

This is a more difficult one to push back on, and has little do do with the main thrust of why I'm writing this.
I'll post that in [another article](2023-02-16-002-is-lisp-blub-now.md).
Long story short, I think the distaste for monads (and by spurious extension, types) is driven
  by Lispers not grokking types, categories, and their relationship.
This lack of grokness I think happens because Lispers consider Lisp the best language,
  whereas I think Lisp is no longer the best programming language.
Again, next entry will include my argument.
