# A Quote on Human vs. Machine Design
tags: lang-design

This is a gloriously stark presentation of this idea:

> There still appears to exist an ongoing debate between two schools of thought regarding the direction for the engineering tradeoffs involved in programming language design when choosing definitions for primitive functions.
> The first school adheres to the principle that programming languages should support those primitive function definitions that are most convenient for programming and problem solving. With this principle, it is up to the compiler designer to bridge to gap (if any) between the definitions and the machine, and to the computer architecture designer to reduce (or annihilate) such a gap, both in the most economical way (regarding time and resources).
> The other school proclaims that the tradeoffs in programming language design must be made in the direction of catering for the properties of machines.
