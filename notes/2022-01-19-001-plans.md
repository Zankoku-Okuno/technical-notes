# Plans for Solidification
tags: plans

I was very eager last weekend to get a start on some new projects,
  but I decided to switch my github over to [edemko](https://github.com/edemko) for work.
At the same time, I also grabbed a domain for myself, for internet presence.
With that in mind, I started making a homepage, but
  that necessitated asking myself what projects I am proud enough of to put in a list of links.

So, both moving my github and making a homepage are requiring me to look through my past work.
No surprise the bug bit me to revisit some that I think _should_ be made, but I haven't done properly.
Chief among these right now is `zedo`, but I've also git ideas for `will` popping up while I work on `zedo`.
Anyway, it's a lot of rabbit holes, and I don't want to be forced to do a depth-first traversal.

This is a place where I can just list the ideas for follow-up during this solidification process.

- [ ] create homepage
- [ ] move github projects
- [ ] minimum viable zedo specification and implementation
- technical journal should have a section for references (tricks, idioms, learning resources, &c)
- [ ] skel
  - [ ] the skel file for will version should use a regex to find the likely version number:
        ```
        VERSION=@@@VERSION@@@
        MAJOR="$(echo $VERSION | cut -d1 '.')"
        â€¦
        r/[ v]($MAJOR$MINOR$PATCH)\.?$/
        ```
- [ ] will
  - [ ] will should come with the ability to print version, not just OK/NO
        ```
        have a `version` script sister to `install` (and perms same)
        that script should just print the version
        sed 's/^$PROGAM\s\+v?//i'
        ```


Finally, I'll be able to focus on [the new stuff plans](2022-01-15-000-plans.md).

A new project, a regex builder (probly written in Haskell):
  * `regex --sed let x = 'a-zA-Z' in '[$x][$x0-9]+'`
    will insert the substitute the binding into the final regex, and format the regex for sed
  * other output options include grep, find, all those tools byt with flags
  * you can also `let :hexDigit: = a-fA-F0-9` to define new character classes
  * you can also `lit x = C++`, which escapes all special characters in the string before substituting
