# Design Goals for a HoTT-based Language

  * MUST be compilable to a textbook.
    Admittedly, the most natural form such a textbook might make is one of those awful
      > Here are the axioms, now I prove some theorems.
      > I assume you know where I'm going with this and why.
  * SHOULD support compiling free-form sections for textbooks.
    That is, documentation not attached specifically to any particular code object.
  * SHOULD allow such textbook to remix the order of source code when presenting.
    This is as opposed to literate programming, where the code, even remarkably boring code, but occur exactly in the same order as the source, leading to garbage like
    ```
    We've got to import a bunch of things.
    Skip over this
    > import Prelude hiding (lookup)
    > 
    > import Data.Map (Map)
    > import Data.Symbol (Symbol)
    >
    > import qualified Data.Map as Map
    > â€¦
    ```
  * SHOULD be able to use such a textbook as API documentation




# TODO

Stop putting documentation in comments.
Documentation is code.
